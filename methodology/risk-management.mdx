Parallax's risk management framework protects portfolios while optimizing for superior risk-adjusted returns. Our multi-dimensional approach combines real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and systematic controls to manage both known and emerging risks.

## Multi-Dimensional Risk Framework

While most platforms focus on simple volatility measures, Parallax monitors risk across multiple dimensions:

  <Card title="Factor Risk" icon="layer-group">
    - **Concentration Monitoring**: Prevent overexposure to any single factor
    - **Interaction Effects**: Track how factors correlate during stress
    - **Style Drift**: Ensure portfolios maintain intended exposures

  <Card title="Market Risk" icon="chart-line">
    - **Volatility Tracking**: Real-time portfolio volatility measurement
    - **Beta Management**: Control systematic market risk exposure
    - **Correlation Analysis**: Monitor changing relationship patterns
  </Card>
  <Card title="Concentration Risk" icon="bullseye">
    - **Position Limits**: Maximum exposure to individual securities
    - **Sector Concentration**: Industry and geographic exposure controls
    - **Factor Concentration**: Prevent over-reliance on single factors

  <Card title="Liquidity Risk" icon="water">
    - **Trading Volume**: Ensure adequate liquidity for position changes
    - **Market Impact**: Estimate costs of portfolio adjustments
    - **Stress Liquidity**: Model liquidity during market stress periods

## Real-Time Risk Monitoring

### Live Monitoring

**Real-Time Metrics**:
- Portfolio volatility and Value-at-Risk (VaR) updated every 15 minutes
- Factor exposures tracked against targets throughout the day
- Concentration measures monitored across all dimensions
- Correlation matrices updated with each market close

**Dynamic Risk Budgeting**:
- Risk allocation across factors, sectors, and individual positions
- Active share measurement against benchmarks
- Tracking error decomposition and analysis
- Expected shortfall and tail risk measurement

**Market Regime Detection**:
- Automatic identification of changing market conditions
- Volatility regime classification (low, normal, high)
- Factor correlation regime monitoring
- Crisis period detection and preparation

### Alert Systems

| Alert Type | Threshold |
|------------|-----------|
| Position size limit | Typically 5% individual position |
| Factor drift | ±2% from target |
| Sector concentration | >20% in single sector |
| Volatility spike | Above client risk tolerance |

**Early Warning Systems**:
- Model degradation indicators

## Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis

### Historical Scenario Analysis

- Performance simulation during major market events (2008, 2020, etc.)
- Factor behavior during different crisis types
- Correlation breakdown analysis during stress periods
- Recovery pattern analysis and timing

### Forward-Looking Stress Tests

| Test Type | Methodology |
|-----------|-------------|
| Monte Carlo simulations | 10,000+ scenarios |
| Economic scenarios | Recession and expansion modeling |
| Rate shock scenarios | Interest rate and inflation stress |
| Black swan events | Geopolitical and tail risk modeling |

### Factor-Specific Stress Tests

- Individual factor breakdown scenarios
- Factor correlation stress testing
- Momentum crash and value trap scenarios
- Quality deterioration and defensive failure tests

## Advanced Risk Controls

### Position-Level Controls

| Control | Typical Limit |
|---------|---------------|
| Maximum position size | 3-5% per individual security |
| Liquidity requirements | Minimum daily volume thresholds |
| Quality screens | Fundamental filters for deteriorating companies |
| Correlation limits | Prevent highly correlated clustering |

### Portfolio-Level Controls

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Volatility targets | Client-specific maximum volatility limits |
| Factor bounds | Tolerance bands around target exposures |
| Sector limits | Maximum exposure to industries |
| Geographic limits | Concentration controls for regions |

### Dynamic Controls

<Note>
**Regime-Aware Limits**: Tighter controls during high volatility periods

**Correlation-Based Sizing**: Position sizes adjust for correlation changes

**Momentum Controls**: Reduced momentum exposure during reversal risks

**Liquidity-Based Limits**: Position sizes reflect current market liquidity
</Note>
