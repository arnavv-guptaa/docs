description: 'Detailed implementation of each factor including metrics, academic foundations, and practical applications'
---

This guide provides comprehensive coverage of each factor in the Parallax framework, including the specific metrics used, academic foundations, when each factor works best, and implementation considerations.

## Value Factor

### Academic Foundation

Benjamin Graham and David Dodd's "Security Analysis" (1934), Fama-French value premium research (1992).

### Key Metrics

```
Value Score = Percentile Rank based on:
  P/E Ratio      - Earnings valuation vs. sector peers
  P/B Ratio      - Book value relative to peers
  EV/EBITDA      - Cash flow-based valuation
  P/S Ratio      - Revenue multiple analysis
  Dividend Yield - Income component assessment

→ Precision-weighted ensemble of these metrics
→ Combined into single percentile score (0-10)
```

### When Value Works

| Market Condition | Value Performance |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Market recovery after declines | Strong |
| Rising interest rate environments | Strong |
| Economic expansion with improving earnings | Strong |
| Periods of reduced speculation | Strong |

### Implementation Risks

<Warning>
**Value Traps**: Cheap stocks that remain cheap or decline further due to fundamental issues.

**Secular Decline**: Industries facing permanent disruption may appear cheap but lack recovery potential.

**Quality Issues**: Low prices may reflect legitimate fundamental problems.

**Timing**: Value can underperform for extended periods (e.g., 2017-2020).
</Warning>

## Quality Factor

### Academic Foundation

Warren Buffett's quality principles, Piotroski F-Score research (2000), Asness, Frazzini, and Pedersen quality factor research (2019).

### Key Metrics

```
Quality Score = Percentile Rank based on:
  Profitability        - ROE, ROA, profit margins
  Financial Strength   - Balance sheet quality metrics
  Earnings Quality     - Sustainability of reported earnings
  Business Stability   - Revenue predictability and growth
  Management Quality   - Capital allocation efficiency
  Forensic Accounting  - Red flag detection and penalties

→ Precision-weighted ensemble of these metrics
→ Combined into single percentile score (0-10)
```

### Forensic Accounting Analysis

Our Quality scoring includes forensic accounting checks:

- Detects earnings manipulation red flags (unusual accruals, revenue recognition issues)
- Identifies balance sheet warning signs (off-balance sheet items, hidden liabilities)
- Penalizes scores for accounting irregularities and disclosure quality issues
- Continuous monitoring of financial statement quality

### Quality Advantages

<Tip>
**Defensive Characteristics**: Outperforms during market stress

**Consistency**: More predictable performance patterns

**Compounding**: Quality characteristics tend to persist over time

**Risk Reduction**: Lower volatility and drawdown periods
</Tip>

## Momentum Factor

### Academic Foundation

Jegadeesh and Titman momentum research (1993), behavioral finance herding and under-reaction research.

### Key Metrics

```
Momentum Score = Percentile Rank based on:
  6-Month Price Return   - Recent performance trajectory
  12-Month Price Return  - Longer-term trend strength
  Earnings Revisions     - Analyst estimate changes
  Revenue Growth         - Sales momentum analysis
  Relative Strength      - Peer comparison metrics

→ Precision-weighted ensemble of these metrics
→ Combined into single percentile score (0-10)
```

### Implementation Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Reversal Risk** | Strong trends can reverse quickly, especially in stress periods |
| **Volatility** | Higher volatility than other factors |
| **Crowding** | Popular momentum trades can become overcrowded |
| **Transaction Costs** | Higher turnover increases implementation costs |

---

## Defensive Factor

### Academic Foundation

Low volatility anomaly research (Baker, Bradley, Wurgler 2011), minimum variance portfolio theory.

### Key Metrics

```
Defensive Score = Percentile Rank based on:
  Low Volatility        - Historical price stability
  Low Beta              - Market sensitivity measurement
  Earnings Stability    - Consistency of financial results
  Dividend Quality      - Payment history and sustainability
  Business Defensiveness - Recession resistance

→ Precision-weighted ensemble of these metrics
→ Combined into single percentile score (0-10)
```

### Defensive Benefits

<Note>
**Downside Protection**: Outperforms during market declines

**Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Often superior Sharpe ratios over full cycles

**Stability**: Lower volatility and more predictable outcomes

**Crisis Performance**: Valuable during uncertain periods
</Note>

## Size Factor

### Academic Foundation

Banz small firm effect (1981), Fama-French size factor inclusion (1992), international evidence across global markets.

### Updated Role

The size factor has evolved from a standalone return premium to a **signal amplifier** that enhances other factor effectiveness:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Attention Gaps** | Smaller companies receive less analyst coverage |
| **Uninformed Flows** | Passive funds typically prefer large/mega-cap stocks |
| **Factor Interaction** | Size amplifies value, momentum, and quality signals |
| **Market Inefficiencies** | Less efficient pricing in smaller company segments |

### Implementation Considerations

<Warning>
**Higher Volatility**: Small-cap stocks typically more volatile

**Liquidity Risk**: Lower liquidity impacts trading costs

**Quality Variation**: Wide range of quality among small companies

**Economic Sensitivity**: Greater exposure to economic cycles
</Warning>

<Note>
**Important**: Size is NOT included in the Overall Score calculation. It is accounted for during portfolio construction to manage liquidity, capacity, and factor amplification.
</Note>

## Tactical Factor

### Academic Foundation

The Tactical factor captures **short-term opportunities arising from temporary supply-demand imbalances and liquidity dislocations**:

- Kyle Model (1985): Informed trader behavior and price impact
- Glosten-Milgrom Model (1985): Market maker pricing and informed trading probability
- Campbell, Grossman & Wang (1993): Non-fundamental trading and return reversals
