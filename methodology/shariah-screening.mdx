title: 'Shariah-Compliant Screening'
description: "Islamic finance screening combining quantitative filters, qualitative deep research, and human scholarly oversight via Guidance Financial's Shariah Supervisory Board"
---

<Note>
**Human + AI Approach:** Our Shariah screening combines automated quantitative filters with deep qualitative research and human scholarly oversight. Machine learning helps prioritize and flag potential issues, but final compliance decisions are made by credentialed Islamic scholars on Guidance Financial's Shariah Supervisory Board.

**Continuous Monitoring:** Shariah compliance is not a one-time certification. We re-evaluate quantitative screens weekly, provide quarterly updates to our Shariah adviser, and conduct annual audits with formal certification.
</Note>

Parallax offers Shariah-compliant investment solutions that adhere to Islamic financial principles without compromising on analytical rigor or portfolio performance. Our methodology combines institutional-grade quantitative analysis with the guidance of one of the world's most respected Shariah Supervisory Boards.

## Executive Summary

**The Challenge:**
Traditional Shariah screening faces a fundamental constraint: human scholars can only review a limited number of securities. A top-down approach—where scholars manually evaluate each company—inevitably leaves thousands of potentially compliant investments unexamined. The result is an artificially constrained investable universe, forcing Muslim investors to choose from a smaller opportunity set than necessary.

This creates a classification problem with obscured labels: a stock is either (1) certified compliant, (2) reviewed and deemed non-compliant, or (3) never reviewed at all. Category three represents lost opportunity.

**Our Solution:**
We invert the traditional approach. Instead of limiting the universe to what scholars can manually review, we use technology to expand what's possible—systematically screening 30,000+ securities to surface candidates for scholarly review. This expands the investable universe while maintaining rigorous human oversight.

Our multi-layer screening process combines:
1. **Quantitative Filters** - Automated financial ratio screens applied across 30,000+ securities
2. **Qualitative Analysis** - Deep research into business activities, revenue sources, and corporate segments
3. **AI-Assisted Research** - Machine learning and natural language processing to flag potential issues and prioritize review
4. **Human Scholarly Oversight** - Final decisions by Guidance Financial's Shariah Supervisory Board

**Why This Matters:**
Different scholars may interpret Islamic principles differently. We apply stringent standards that satisfy requirements across multiple schools of Islamic jurisprudence, ensuring broad acceptability while maintaining investment quality.

**Global Coverage:**
Our screening covers global equities across all major markets, subject to public reporting availability. This includes developed markets (US, Europe, Japan, Australia) and emerging markets (Asia, Middle East, Latin America) where companies file standardized financial disclosures.

## Multi-Layer Screening Framework

Our screening methodology is not straightforward—it requires significant manual effort, cross-referencing multiple data sources, and scholarly judgment. This deliberate complexity ensures robust compliance while making the process difficult to replicate superficially.

### Layer 1: Quantitative Screens (Automated)

The first layer applies clear, measurable financial thresholds. These screens run automatically across our entire universe weekly.

**Financial Ratio Thresholds:**

| Metric | Threshold | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Interest-bearing debt / Total assets | Less than 30% | Limits exposure to riba (interest) |
| Cash + equivalents + short-term investments / Total assets | Less than 30% | Restricts interest-generating holdings |
| Cash + equivalents + receivables / Total assets | Less than 45% | Ensures operational rather than financial business model |
| Interest income / Net income | Less than 5% | Caps non-compliant income sources |

**Business Activity Revenue Threshold:**
Cumulative revenue from non-compliant activities must not exceed **5% of total income**. Non-compliant activities include:

- Conventional financial services (banking, insurance, brokerage)
- Alcohol production or distribution
- Gambling and gaming
- Tobacco products
- Adult entertainment
- Pork-related products
- Weapons manufacturing
- Conventional interest income

<Warning>
These quantitative thresholds represent the starting point, not the final determination. Passing all quantitative screens does not guarantee Shariah compliance—qualitative analysis must confirm the nature of business activities.
</Warning>

**Concrete Example:**
> **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** typically passes quantitative screens with debt/assets around 15% and minimal direct non-compliant revenue. However, qualitative review examines Apple's financial services (Apple Pay, Apple Card partnership with Goldman Sachs) to ensure financial services exposure remains below thresholds.
>
> **Goldman Sachs (GS)** fails at the quantitative stage—as a conventional bank, the majority of revenue derives from interest-bearing activities, exceeding all financial ratio thresholds.
>
> **A mixed-revenue company** like Amazon requires deeper analysis: AWS and e-commerce are compliant, but Amazon's lending products and interest income require segment-level revenue decomposition to determine if non-compliant revenue stays below 5%.

### Layer 2: Qualitative Deep Research

This is where the process becomes genuinely complex. Many companies require significant manual investigation that cannot be fully automated.

**Business Activity Analysis:**
- Review of company filings, annual reports, and regulatory disclosures
- Analysis of revenue breakdown by business segment
- Investigation of subsidiary activities and joint ventures
- Assessment of supply chain relationships

**Segment-Level Investigation:**
A company may appear compliant at the consolidated level but have non-compliant subsidiaries or business lines. We analyze:
- Geographic segment reporting
- Product line revenue decomposition
- Subsidiary ownership structures
- Recent M&A activity that may change compliance status

**News and Event Monitoring:**
Continuous monitoring for developments that could affect compliance:
- New product launches into prohibited categories
- Acquisitions of non-compliant businesses
- Strategic pivots affecting revenue composition
- Regulatory changes affecting business classification

### Layer 3: AI-Assisted Synthesis

We use large language models, web search, and proprietary algorithms to support—not replace—human judgment.

**Machine Learning Applications:**
- **Classification Models:** Random forest algorithms trained on labeled compliance data predict likelihood of Shariah compliance (~80% accuracy), helping prioritize which securities need detailed human review
- **Natural Language Processing:** Automated analysis of business descriptions, earnings call transcripts, and news articles to flag potential issues
- **Cross-Reference Validation:** Systematic comparison across multiple data sources to identify inconsistencies

**What AI Does:**
- Flags securities requiring additional scrutiny
- Identifies discrepancies between reported data and actual business activities
- Monitors news feeds for compliance-relevant events
- Prioritizes the queue of securities for human review

**What AI Does Not Do:**
- Make final compliance determinations
- Override Shariah board decisions
- Replace scholarly interpretation of edge cases

<Note>
Our AI models are trained to be conservative—they flag potential issues for human review rather than making autonomous compliance decisions. This human-in-the-loop approach ensures that scholarly judgment remains central to the process.
</Note>

### Layer 4: Scholarly Oversight

Final compliance decisions rest with Guidance Financial's Shariah Supervisory Board, one of the most respected advisory bodies in Islamic finance.

## Scholarly Standards & Governance

### AAOIFI Compliance

Our methodology adheres to standards set by the **Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI)**, the leading international body for Islamic finance standards. AAOIFI standards are mandatory in Bahrain, Sudan, and Jordan, and are widely adopted as best practice across Islamic financial institutions globally.

### Two-Layer Certification Process

We implement a two-layer Shariah screening process:

1. **Refinitiv Islamic Indices** (First Layer): The Refinitiv Shariah screening methodology is a market-accepted mandate approved by prominent Shariah scholars. Over 30,000 publicly listed securities are screened monthly, providing a reliable baseline universe.

2. **Guidance Investments** (Second Layer): Where methodologies differ, we apply Guidance Investments' more stringent classification. This conservative approach ensures compliance across multiple interpretive frameworks.

### Board Engagement

The Shariah Supervisory Board is actively engaged in oversight, not merely advisory:

- **Quarterly Reviews**: Formal portfolio composition reports and reclassification decisions
- **Annual Shariah Audit**: Comprehensive review with formal certification letter issued
- **Ad-Hoc Consultations**: Edge cases and novel situations escalated for board ruling
- **Methodology Updates**: Board reviews and approves any changes to screening criteria

### Accountability Structure

- All compliance decisions are logged with timestamps and rationale
- Reclassification events trigger documented divestment plans
- Annual audit report submitted to the Shariah board for review
- Certification letter available to investors upon request

---

## Continuous Compliance Monitoring

Shariah compliance is dynamic—a compliant company today may become non-compliant tomorrow due to business changes, financing decisions, or market conditions.

### Monitoring Cadence

| Activity | Frequency | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Quantitative re-screening | Weekly | Automated check of financial ratios against thresholds |
| News and event monitoring | Daily | AI-assisted scanning for compliance-relevant developments |
| Qualitative review | Ongoing | Deep research triggered by quantitative flags or news events |
| Shariah adviser update | Quarterly | Formal report on portfolio status, changes, and reclassifications |
| Shariah audit | Annual | Comprehensive review with formal certification letter |

### Reclassification Protocol

When a security is reclassified from compliant to non-compliant:

**If the position shows a gain:**
- Exit within 5 working days
- Any gains from time of reclassification are subject to purification

**If the position shows a loss:**
- May hold up to 3 months waiting for recovery to cost basis
- Must exit immediately if market value recovers to investment cost
- Extensions require special dispensation from the Shariah board

**Documentation:**
- Reclassification log maintained with rationale
- Divestment plan or proof of disposal furnished within 5 working days
- All purification amounts tracked and reported

### Adding and Removing Securities

The investable universe is not static. Securities are:

**Added when:**
- New IPOs pass both quantitative and qualitative screens
- Previously non-compliant companies change their business model
- Improved data reveals a company was incorrectly classified
- The Shariah board approves specific inclusions

**Removed when:**
- Financial ratios breach thresholds
- Business activities shift into prohibited categories
- M&A activity changes the compliance profile
- News or filings reveal previously unknown non-compliant activities

---

## Income Purification

Even compliant companies may generate small amounts of non-compliant income (typically from interest on cash holdings). This income must be "purified" through charitable donation.

### Purification Calculation

**For dividend income:**
```
Purification Amount = (Non-compliant revenue / Total revenue) × Dividend received
```

**For gains from reclassified securities:**
Any capital appreciation occurring after reclassification (from the date of status change to the date of sale) must be purified.

**For interest on cash:**
All interest received on fund cash holdings from brokers or banks must be purified.

### Purification Process

1. Non-compliant income calculated and tracked throughout the year
2. Charitable organizations proposed by fund manager for Shariah board approval
3. Donations made on annual basis as part of Shariah audit
4. Receipts obtained and retained for all purification payments
5. Annual report detailing all purification submitted to Shariah board

### Approved Charitable Recipients

Purification funds are donated to charities approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board. Approved recipients include organizations focused on:
- Poverty alleviation and economic empowerment
- Education and skills development
- Healthcare access in underserved communities
- Humanitarian relief

One example partner is **Arba Foundation**, which focuses on breaking the poverty cycle through sustainable development initiatives. The Shariah board reviews and approves all charitable recipients to ensure funds are distributed appropriately and in accordance with Islamic principles.

| Interest-bearing borrowing | No | Fund cannot borrow at interest |
| Interest receipt | Purified | Any interest received must be donated to charity |
| Security types | Ordinary shares only | Other instruments require specific Shariah board approval |

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="General">
    **What makes a stock Shariah-compliant?**
    A stock must pass both quantitative screens (financial ratios below specified thresholds) and qualitative screens (business activities not in prohibited categories). Final determination requires Shariah board approval.

    **Can I invest in technology companies?**
    Yes, most technology companies are Shariah-compliant. The key considerations are debt levels and whether any business segments involve prohibited activities.

    **What about companies with small amounts of non-compliant revenue?**
    Companies with less than 5% of revenue from non-compliant sources may still be investable, but that portion of any dividends received must be purified through charitable donation.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Methodology">
    **How often are screens updated?**
    Quantitative screens run weekly. Qualitative reviews are triggered by news events, corporate actions, or quarterly reporting cycles.

    **What data sources do you use?**
    We combine commercial data providers (Refinitiv, FactSet) with proprietary research, regulatory filings, news monitoring, and Shariah board input.

    **How accurate is the AI screening?**
    Our machine learning models achieve approximately 80% accuracy in predicting Shariah compliance within developed market indices. However, AI serves to prioritize human review, not make final decisions.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Practical">
    **What happens if a stock I own becomes non-compliant?**
    You'll be notified of the reclassification. If the position shows a gain, it should be sold within 5 working days. If at a loss, you may hold up to 3 months waiting for recovery. Gains after reclassification require purification.

    **How do I calculate purification for my portfolio?**
    The Portfolio Analyzer can identify non-compliant income and calculate required purification amounts. Generally, apply the ratio of non-compliant revenue to total revenue against dividends received.

    **Can I get documentation for my compliance files?**
    Yes, we provide annual certification letters, quarterly reports, and detailed compliance logs suitable for regulatory and client documentation requirements.
