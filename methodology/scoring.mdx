description: 'How Parallax calculates factor scores, integrates them with ML optimization, and generates investment recommendations'

Our scoring system transforms complex financial data into clear, actionable investment insights. Built on Fama-French factor research and other academic foundations, our models incorporate real-time data and contemporary measures.

## Score Calculation Process

### Individual Factor Scores (0-10 Scale)

Scores represent **rounded percentiles** within the investment universe:

| Score Range | Percentile | Interpretation |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **8-10** | Top quartile | Strong to exceptional performance |
| **6-7** | Above median | Moderately attractive |
| **4-5** | Below median | Neutral to weak |
| **0-3** | Bottom quartile | Poor to very poor performance |

<Note>
**Percentile Interpretation**: A Value score of 10 means the stock is in the **top 10% cheapest** relative to fundamentals. A Quality score of 3 means it's in the **bottom 20%** for business quality metrics.
</Note>

### Overall Parallax Score Integration

The Overall Score uses a **machine learning model** that dynamically adapts to changing market environments:

```
Overall Score = ML-Optimized Combination of:
  Value Factor     (10-40% dynamic weight)
  Quality Factor   (10-40% dynamic weight)
  Momentum Factor  (10-40% dynamic weight)
  Defensive Factor (10-40% dynamic weight)
  Tactical Factor  (10-40% dynamic weight)

Note: Size is NOT included in Overall Score calculation
```

## ML Optimization Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Predict Returns">
    Models forecast expected returns for each factor based on current market regime
  </Step>
  <Step title="Estimate Covariances">
    Predicts how factors will correlate in the near-term
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimize Weights">
    Allocates to factors with best risk-adjusted return forecasts
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enforce Limits">
    Each factor weight constrained between 10% (minimum) and 40% (maximum)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Periodic Updates">
    Weights recalculated periodically as market conditions evolve
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Example**: During high-volatility periods, the ML model might increase Defensive factor weight to 35% and reduce Momentum to 15%, automatically adapting your strategy to market conditions.
</Tip>

## Size Factor Treatment

The Size factor has a unique role in the framework:

| Aspect | Treatment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Overall Score** | Size does NOT contribute to individual stock recommendations |
| **Portfolio Construction** | Size is systematically incorporated during portfolio building |
| **Liquidity Management** | Ensures adequate trading capacity and minimizes market impact |
| **Capacity Constraints** | Helps manage strategy scalability and position sizing |
| **Factor Amplification** | Small-cap exposure can amplify other factor signals |

## Recommendation Generation

Overall scores translate directly into investment recommendations:

| Score Range | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **8.5-10.0** | STRONG BUY |
| **6.5-8.4** | BUY |
| **3.5-6.4** | HOLD |
| **1.5-3.4** | SELL |
| **0.0-1.4** | STRONG SELL |

## Score Validation and Quality Control

### Multi-Source Verification

- Cross-validation across fundamental, technical, and alternative data
- Peer comparison within sector and market cap categories
- Historical score performance tracking
- Outlier detection and manual review processes

### Dynamic Adjustment via ML Model

| Adjustment Type | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Market Regime Detection** | Identifies changing market conditions (bull, bear, high-vol, low-vol) |
| **Adaptive Factor Weights** | ML model adjusts Overall Score weights periodically within 10-40% bounds |
| **Covariance Forecasting** | Predicts how factors will correlate in current regime |
| **Return Prediction** | Estimates near-term factor performance based on market environment |
| **Sector-Specific Adjustments** | Scoring refined for industry-specific characteristics |
| **Event-Driven Modifications** | Earnings season and corporate action adjustments |

## Performance Attribution

Understanding where returns come from through factor decomposition:

```
Example 6-Month Performance Attribution:
Total Return: +8.3%
  Market Beta (1.1):      +5.2%
  Value Factor (0.4):     -0.8%
  Momentum Factor (0.6):  +2.1%
  Quality Factor (0.5):   +1.4%
  Size Factor (-0.2):     -0.3%
  Tactical Factor (0.2):  +0.4%
  Security Selection:     +0.3%
```

### Factor Risk Analysis

Understanding portfolio risk sources through factor decomposition:

- **Systematic Risk**: Market and factor exposures
- **Specific Risk**: Individual security risk
- **Concentration Risk**: Factor and sector concentrations
- **Correlation Risk**: How holdings relate during stress periods
