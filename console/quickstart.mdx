**Start experiencing Parallax's value in under 5 minutes.** The fastest way to see what makes Parallax powerful is to upload your existing portfolio and get instant AI-powered insights.

## Step 1: Access Parallax & Upload Your Portfolio

**Your existing portfolio is your starting point.** Parallax's core value comes from analyzing what you already own.

1. **Navigate to the Platform**: Go to [parallax.chicago.global](https://parallax.chicago.global)
2. **Sign In**: Click "Sign In" in the top right corner or "Get Started" for new accounts
3. **Go Directly to Analyzer**: Click the **"Analyzer"** tab in the main navigation
4. **Upload Your Portfolio**:
   - Click "Upload Portfolio" or "Import Holdings"
   - Enter your holdings manually (ticker symbols and quantities)
   - Or upload a CSV/Excel file with your positions

<Note>
**Why start here?** Most investment platforms make you start from scratch. Parallax's AI analyzes your existing portfolio first, then shows you exactly how to improve it.
</Note>

## Step 2: Get Instant AI-Powered Insights

Once your portfolio is uploaded, Parallax's AI immediately analyzes your holdings and generates powerful insights:

**What You'll See Instantly:**
1. **Portfolio Dashboard**: Overall portfolio score, risk level, and performance metrics
2. **Factor Analysis**: How your portfolio scores on Value, Quality, Momentum, Defensive, and Size factors
3. **Risk Assessment**: Concentration risk, sector allocation, and diversification analysis
4. **AI Insights**: Personalized recommendations and risk alerts
5. **Performance Attribution**: Which holdings are helping/hurting your returns

**Key Questions Parallax Answers:**
- "What are my biggest risks right now?"
- "Which holdings should I consider selling?"
- "Where am I over/under-exposed?"
- "How does my portfolio compare to institutional strategies?"

<Tip>
**Game-Changer**: This analysis typically costs $1000+ from wealth managers. Parallax delivers it instantly and updates it continuously.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Chat with Your Portfolio

**Ask your portfolio questions using natural language.** Parallax's AI can answer complex questions about your investments.

**Try These Questions:**
- "What would happen to my portfolio if interest rates increase by 2%?"
- "Which of my holdings are most vulnerable to interest rate increases?"
- "Show me stocks similar to Apple but with better value scores"
- "What sectors am I under-weighted in compared to the S&P 500?"
- "Which of my positions have the worst momentum?"

**Advanced AI Analysis:**
- **Scenario Analysis**: "How would my portfolio perform in a recession?"
- **Factor Exposure**: "Am I too concentrated in growth stocks?"
- **Risk Assessment**: "What's my biggest single-stock risk?"
- **Optimization**: "How can I improve my risk-adjusted returns?"

<Note>
**AI Advantage**: This is like having a quantitative analyst available 24/7. Ask questions you'd never think to ask traditional tools.
