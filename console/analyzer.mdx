**Transform your existing holdings into actionable insights.** The Portfolio Analyzer applies institutional-grade quantitative methods to any portfolio, providing the same level of analysis used by billion-dollar endowments and hedge funds.

Most investment tools focus on picking new stocks. The Portfolio Analyzer starts with what you already own, then reveals hidden risks, optimization opportunities, and performance drivers using rigorous academic methodology.

## Conceptual Foundation

### The Portfolio-First Approach

Traditional investment analysis often examines securities in isolation. Modern Portfolio Theory, developed by Harry Markowitz in 1952, demonstrated that portfolio-level analysis is fundamental—the risk and return of individual holdings matter less than how they work together.

**Key Principles**:
- **Diversification Benefits**: How holdings correlate affects total portfolio risk
- **Factor Exposure**: Securities share common risk factors (value, growth, size, quality)
- **Performance Attribution**: Understanding what drives returns enables better decisions
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Mathematical methods can improve risk-adjusted returns

| **Total Portfolio Value** | Current market value of all holdings |
| **Total Return** | Performance since portfolio inception or specified period |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | Risk-adjusted return measurement |
| **Volatility** | Portfolio standard deviation |
| **Beta** | Market sensitivity |
| **Maximum Drawdown** | Largest peak-to-trough decline |
| **Parallax Score** | Proprietary composite score (0-100) evaluating overall portfolio quality |

**Asset Allocation Breakdown**:
- Sector allocation with over/underweights vs. market
- Geographic distribution
- Market cap distribution
- Growth vs. value tilt

### Performance Tab: Return Analysis

#### Time-Period Analysis

**Returns Across Multiple Periods**:
- 1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month, 3 Month, 6 Month, 1 Year, 3 Year
- Comparison to relevant benchmarks (S&P 500, total market, custom)
- Risk-adjusted performance metrics for each period

#### Performance Attribution

**Understanding What Drives Returns**:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Security Selection** | How individual stock picks contributed to performance relative to sector averages |
| **Sector Allocation** | Impact of being overweight or underweight in specific sectors |
| **Factor Exposure** | Contribution from value, growth, momentum, quality, and size factors |
| **Currency Impact** | For international holdings, effect of currency movements |

**Example Attribution Analysis**:
```
Total Portfolio Return: +12.3% (vs. S&P 500: +8.7%)
  Security Selection: +2.1%
  Sector Allocation: +1.8%
  Factor Tilts: +1.2%
  Currency/Other: -1.5%
```

### Risk Tab: Comprehensive Risk Assessment

#### Traditional Risk Metrics

**Volatility Analysis**:
- Annualized standard deviation
- Downside deviation (volatility of negative returns)
- Tracking error vs. benchmark

**Value at Risk (VaR)**: Statistical measure of potential losses over specific time horizons with given confidence levels.
- 1-day 95% VaR: "95% confident you won't lose more than X% in one day"
- 1-month 99% VaR: More extreme scenario analysis

#### Advanced Risk Decomposition

**Factor Risk Attribution** - Understanding portfolio risk sources:

| Risk Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Market Risk** | Systematic risk from overall market movements |
| **Size Risk** | Exposure to small vs. large-cap stocks |
| **Value Risk** | Exposure to value vs. growth factors |
| **Momentum Risk** | Exposure to recent price trends |
| **Quality Risk** | Exposure to fundamental quality metrics |
| **Sector Risk** | Concentration risk from sector bets |

#### Stress Testing

**Historical Scenario Analysis** - How would your portfolio have performed during major market events?

- 2008 Financial Crisis
- COVID-19 Market Crash (March 2020)
- Dot-com Bubble Burst (2000-2002)
- European Debt Crisis (2011)

**Agentic Impact Analysis**: Sophisticated scenario analysis powered by multi-agent AI workflow featuring 5-10 specialized agent layers that collaborate to evaluate portfolio impact across different market scenarios.

**Monte Carlo Simulation**: Statistical modeling of potential future outcomes based on historical patterns and correlations.

### Holdings Tab: Individual Security Analysis

**Parallax Scores by Holding** - Each position receives individual factor scores (0-10 scale):

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Value Score** | Based on valuation metrics (P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA, etc.) |
| **Quality Score** | Financial strength, profitability, and stability |
| **Momentum Score** | Price and earnings momentum indicators |
| **Defensive Score** | Low volatility and stable earnings characteristics |
| **Size Score** | Market cap factor exposure |

**Position Analysis**:
- Portfolio weight vs. benchmark weight
- Contribution to total return
- Risk contribution to portfolio
- Liquidity assessment
- ESG scores (where applicable)

### Factor Exposure Tab: Quantitative Analysis

#### Understanding Factor Loadings

**What Are Factors?** Factors are common characteristics that explain security returns. Academic research has identified several persistent factors that drive investment performance.

**Your Portfolio's Factor Exposure**:

| Factor | Positive Loading | Negative Loading |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Size Factor** | Tilted toward smaller companies | Tilted toward larger companies |
| **Value Factor** | Value-oriented portfolio | Growth-oriented portfolio |
| **Momentum Factor** | Momentum strategy | Contrarian strategy |
| **Quality Factor** | Quality-focused | Speculative holdings |

#### Factor Performance Attribution

```
3-Month Performance Attribution:
  Market Beta (1.15): +1.8%
  Value Factor (-0.3): -0.7%
  Size Factor (0.1): +0.2%
  Momentum Factor (0.8): +2.1%
  Quality Factor (0.5): +1.2%
```

**Interpretation**: Your portfolio benefited from positive momentum and quality exposure but was hurt by slight growth tilt during a value rally.

### Optimization Tab: Improvement Recommendations

## Best Practices

### Regular Analysis Schedule

| Frequency | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| **Monthly** | Track performance and rebalancing needs |
| **Quarterly** | Comprehensive analysis including factor exposures |
| **Annual** | Strategic review - assess alignment with long-term objectives |

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

- **Over-Optimization**: Don't chase perfection—focus on material improvements
- **Ignoring Costs**: Factor transaction costs and taxes into decisions
- **Recency Bias**: Consider long-term patterns, not just recent performance
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Take action on clear insights rather than endless analysis
