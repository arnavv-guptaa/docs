## Getting Started with Stock Screening

### Understanding the Screener Interface

| Panel | Features |
|-------|----------|
| **Filter Panel** (Left) | Basic filters, factor scores, fundamental metrics, technical indicators, custom filters |
| **Results Panel** (Center) | Real-time results list, customizable columns, sorting options, action buttons |
| **Detail Panel** (Right) | Individual stock analysis, factor breakdown, peer comparison, integration options |

### Your First Screen: Step-by-Step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Your Investment Universe">
    Start with broad parameters:
    - Market Cap: All (or specify Large/Mid/Small cap preference)
    - Geography: US (expand internationally as you get comfortable)
    - Sectors: All (or focus on sectors you understand)
    - Minimum Volume: 100,000 shares/day (ensures liquidity)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Basic Factor Criteria">
    Begin with simple factor requirements:
    - Overall Parallax Score: > 6 (above average quality)
    - Quality Factor: > 5 (basic quality threshold)
    - Value OR Momentum: > 6 (choose based on market conditions)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Refine Results">
    - Review the number of results (aim for 20-100 for detailed analysis)
    - If too few results: Lower factor thresholds or expand universe
    - If too many results: Tighten criteria or add additional filters
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze Top Candidates">
    - Sort by Overall Parallax Score or your preferred metric
    - Review top 10-20 results in detail
    - Click individual stocks for comprehensive analysis
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration with Platform Features

### From Screener to Portfolio

**Workflow Example**:
1. **Screen**: Find high-quality dividend stocks
2. **Export**: Send top 20 results to portfolio builder
3. **Build**: Create optimized dividend portfolio
4. **Analyze**: Upload to analyzer for comprehensive review
5. **Implement**: Execute trades based on analysis

### Using Chat for Screening Enhancement

**AI-Assisted Screening**:
```
Chat Query: "What screening criteria should I use to find technology
companies that could benefit from the current AI trend?"

AI Response: Suggests specific factors, metrics, and sub-sector focus
Follow-up: Apply suggested criteria in screener
Validation: Discuss results with AI for refinement
```

### Watchlist Integration

**Systematic Monitoring**:
1. **Create Themed Watchlists**: Group screened stocks by strategy
2. **Set Factor Alerts**: Monitor when stocks meet/fail screening criteria
3. **Performance Tracking**: Track how screened stocks perform over time
4. **Rebalancing Signals**: Identify when holdings no longer meet criteria

## Screening Best Practices

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

<Warning>
**Over-Optimization**: Don't create overly complex screens that produce few results. Focus on 3-5 key criteria rather than 15-20 filters.

**Neglecting Qualitative Factors**: Use screening as a starting point, not the final decision. Consider management quality, competitive position, and industry trends.

**Ignoring Market Conditions**: Adapt screening criteria to current market environment. Understand which factors work in different market cycles.

**Poor Risk Management**: Consider position sizing and portfolio impact. Don't ignore correlation risk among screened stocks.
</Warning>

### Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Backtesting** | Test historical performance of screening criteria; optimize for risk-adjusted returns |
| **Dynamic Screening** | Adjust factor weightings based on market conditions; use economic indicators |
| **Portfolio Context** | Consider existing portfolio when screening; screen for stocks that improve factor balance |

## Advanced Screening Applications

### Event-Driven Screening

```

```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Causes | Solutions |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Too Few Results** | Criteria too restrictive, unfavorable market conditions | Lower factor thresholds, expand geographic/sector universe |
| **Too Many Results** | Criteria too broad, bull market conditions | Add quality filters, tighten factor requirements |
| **Poor Performance** | Market regime change, over-fitted criteria | Adapt to current conditions, simplify criteria |
