**Upload your portfolio. Get instant AI-powered insights.** Parallax analyzes your existing investments and tells you exactly what institutional-grade portfolio managers would do differently.

Most investment platforms make you start from scratch. Parallax starts with what you already own, then shows you how to optimize it using the same quantitative methods that power billion-dollar endowments and hedge funds.

## Why Portfolio-Based Analysis Matters

Since Harry Markowitz's groundbreaking 1952 Modern Portfolio Theory, we've understood a fundamental truth: **individual securities must be evaluated in portfolio context, not in isolation.**

A stock might look attractive on its own—strong fundamentals, compelling valuation, positive momentum. But if it's redundant with your existing holdings, adding it increases concentration risk without providing additional returns. You're taking more risk for the same exposure.

**The Portfolio Paradox**:
- A "great" tech stock might be terrible for a tech-heavy portfolio
- A "mediocre" defensive stock might be exactly what reduces your portfolio's volatility
- Five individually "good" stocks in the same sector create dangerous concentration
- Diversification isn't just holding many stocks—it's holding stocks that work differently

This is why Parallax starts with portfolio analysis, not stock picking. We show you what you're actually exposed to—hidden concentrations, factor imbalances, correlation risks—then recommend changes that improve your risk-adjusted returns.

### Core Value Proposition

**Systematic Intelligence**:
Built on decades of academic research from the University of Chicago, including Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz, 1952) and the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (Fama, 1960s), extended through contemporary factor investing research.

**AI-Powered Analytics**:
Machine learning algorithms process vast datasets to identify investment opportunities and risk patterns that traditional analysis might miss.

**Institutional-Grade Infrastructure**:
The same quantitative engine that manages institutional portfolios, now accessible through a user-friendly platform.
