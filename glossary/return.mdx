Return measures the percentage change in investment value over a period, including any income received. It's the most fundamental measure of investment performance.

## Beginner

### What It Means

Return tells you how much you made (or lost) on an investment, expressed as a percentage of your starting value.

### Basic Calculation

```
Return = (Ending Value - Beginning Value + Income) / Beginning Value

Example:
- Buy stock at $100
- Receive $3 dividend
- Sell at $110
- Return = ($110 - $100 + $3) / $100 = 13%
```

### Types of Returns

| Type | What It Includes |
|------|------------------|
| **Price Return** | Price change only |
| **Total Return** | Price change + dividends/income |
| **Annualized Return** | Return expressed as yearly rate |
| **Cumulative Return** | Total return over entire period |

### Why It Matters

Return is the bottom line - did your investment make money? Everything else (risk, volatility, Sharpe ratio) provides context, but return is what you actually earn.

### Return Calculation Methods

| Method | Formula | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Simple** | (End - Start) / Start | Single period |
| **Logarithmic** | ln(End / Start) | Continuous compounding |
| **Time-Weighted** | Geometric link of sub-periods | Manager evaluation |
| **Money-Weighted** | IRR of cash flows | Investor experience |

### Time-Weighted vs. Money-Weighted

| Type | Considers Cash Flows? | Best For |
|------|----------------------|----------|
| **Time-Weighted (TWR)** | No | Manager performance |
| **Money-Weighted (MWR)** | Yes | Investor experience |

<Note>
Time-weighted return removes the effect of when money was added/withdrawn, isolating manager skill. Money-weighted return shows what the investor actually earned.
</Note>

### Annualization

Converting returns to annual rates:

```
Annualized Return = (1 + Total Return)^(1/Years) - 1

Example:
- 50% cumulative return over 3 years
- Annualized = (1.50)^(1/3) - 1 = 14.5% per year
```

### Geometric vs. Arithmetic Mean

| Type | Formula | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Arithmetic** | Sum / N | Expected single-period return |
| **Geometric** | (Product)^(1/N) - 1 | Actual compound growth |

```
Example: Years with +50% then -50%
- Arithmetic mean: (50 + -50) / 2 = 0%
- Geometric mean: √(1.5 × 0.5) - 1 = -13.4%
- Reality: $100 → $150 → $75 (you lost money!)
```

<Warning>
Arithmetic mean overstates compound returns. Always use geometric mean for multi-period performance.
</Warning>

### Real vs. Nominal Returns

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Nominal** | Return before inflation adjustment |
| **Real** | Return after subtracting inflation |

```
Real Return ≈ Nominal Return - Inflation

Example:
- Nominal return: 8%
- Inflation: 3%
- Real return: ~5%
```

### After-Tax Returns

Different return measures for tax impact:

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pre-Tax** | Return before taxes |
| **After-Tax (Pre-Liquidation)** | After taxes paid during holding |
| **After-Tax (Post-Liquidation)** | After all taxes including sale |

### Return Attribution

Breaking down where returns came from:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Market Return** | Broad market movement |
| **Sector Allocation** | Sector over/underweights |
| **Stock Selection** | Individual stock picks |
| **Interaction** | Combined effects |

### Historical Context

Long-term annualized returns (US):

| Asset | Return | Period |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Stocks | 10% | 1926-present |
| Bonds | 5% | 1926-present |
| T-Bills | 3% | 1926-present |
| Inflation | 3% | 1926-present |

### Return Expectations

<Note>
Historical returns don't guarantee future returns. Current valuations, interest rates, and economic conditions affect forward expectations.
