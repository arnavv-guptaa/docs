A benchmark is a standard against which investment performance is measured. Choosing the right benchmark is critical - the wrong benchmark makes performance comparisons meaningless.

## Beginner

### What It Means

A benchmark is your measuring stick. It answers: "Compared to what?" When you say your portfolio returned 12%, the natural question is whether that's good or bad. A benchmark provides context.

### Common Benchmarks

| Asset Class | Common Benchmarks |
|-------------|-------------------|
| US Large-Cap Stocks | S&P 500 |
| US Total Market | Russell 3000, Wilshire 5000 |
| US Small-Cap | Russell 2000 |
| International Developed | MSCI EAFE |
| Emerging Markets | MSCI Emerging Markets |
| US Bonds | Bloomberg US Aggregate |
| 60/40 Portfolio | 60% S&P 500 / 40% Bloomberg Agg |

### Portfolio Example

Your US large-cap portfolio returned 12% this year. How did you do?

| Benchmark | Return | Your Performance |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| S&P 500 | 10% | Beat by 2% |
| Russell 1000 | 11% | Beat by 1% |
| Nasdaq | 15% | Underperformed by 3% |

The benchmark you choose changes the story entirely.

### Why It Matters

Without a benchmark, you can't evaluate performance. A 15% return sounds great, but not if the market returned 25%. A 5% return sounds weak, but not if the market lost 10%.

### Benchmark Characteristics

A good benchmark should be:

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Investable** | Can actually buy the benchmark |
| **Measurable** | Returns can be calculated |
| **Appropriate** | Matches the investment mandate |
| **Unambiguous** | Clearly defined constituents |
| **Specified in Advance** | Not changed after the fact |
| **Reflective of Opportunities** | Represents available investments |

### Benchmark Mismatch

<Warning>
**Benchmark mismatch** is comparing a portfolio to an inappropriate benchmark. A small-cap value fund shouldn't be compared to the S&P 500 - it should be compared to a small-cap value index.
</Warning>

**Common Mismatches:**
- Comparing global funds to US-only benchmarks
- Comparing concentrated portfolios to broad indices
- Comparing multi-asset portfolios to equity-only benchmarks

### Index Construction Methods

| Method | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Market-Cap Weighted** | Larger companies = bigger weight | S&P 500, MSCI |
| **Equal Weighted** | All stocks weighted equally | S&P 500 Equal Weight |
| **Price Weighted** | Higher price = bigger weight | Dow Jones |
| **Factor Weighted** | Weighted by factor scores | Smart beta indices |
| **Fundamentally Weighted** | Weighted by earnings, sales | FTSE RAFI |

### Custom Benchmarks

When no standard index fits, create a custom benchmark:

```
Example Custom Benchmark:
- 50% S&P 500
- 30% MSCI EAFE
- 20% Bloomberg Aggregate

This matches a global balanced portfolio better than any single index.
```

### Benchmark-Relative Metrics

| Metric | Formula | What It Measures |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **Active Return** | Portfolio - Benchmark | Raw outperformance |
| **Tracking Error** | Std Dev of Active Return | Consistency of difference |
| **Information Ratio** | Active Return / TE | Risk-adjusted outperformance |
| **Beta** | Sensitivity to benchmark | Market exposure |

### Benchmark Hugging vs. High Active Share

| Behavior | Active Share | Tracking Error | Fee Appropriateness |
|----------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Closet Indexer | Low | Low | Overpaying |
| True Active | High | Higher | Appropriate if skilled |
| Index Fund | Very Low | Very Low | Appropriate |

### Gaming Benchmarks

Managers may choose easy-to-beat benchmarks:

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Cash Drag** | Compare equity fund to cash-heavy benchmark |
| **Style Mismatch** | Growth fund vs. broad market |
| **Survivorship** | Compare to indices with failed stocks removed |

<Note>
Always verify that the benchmark is truly appropriate for the strategy. Outperformance vs. the wrong benchmark is meaningless.
</Note>

### Peer Benchmarking

Alternative to index benchmarks:

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Index Benchmark | Clear, investable | May not match strategy |
| Peer Group | Compares similar strategies | Survivorship bias, varying strategies |
