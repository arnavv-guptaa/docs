description: 'Understanding factor-adjusted alpha - measuring true skill after removing factor exposures'
---

Factor-adjusted alpha is the return you generated that cannot be explained by known investment factors like market, value, size, or momentum. It isolates genuine stock-picking skill from factor exposures.

## Beginner

### What It Means

Regular alpha can be misleading - a "value fund" might show high alpha just from value stock exposure, not manager skill. Factor-adjusted alpha removes all known factor effects to reveal true skill.

### Portfolio Example

- Your portfolio returned 16% this year
- S&P 500 returned 10% (6% apparent excess return)
- But your portfolio has heavy value exposure, and value beat growth by 4%
- **Factor-Adjusted Alpha = 16% - (10% market + 4% value) = 2%**

Your real skill added 2%, not the apparent 6%.

### Why It Matters

Factor-adjusted alpha reveals whether a manager has genuine stock-picking ability or is simply riding factor exposures that could be obtained cheaply through factor ETFs.

### Mathematical Definition

```
Factor-Adjusted Alpha (α) = Rp - [Rf + Σ(βi × Fi)]

Fama-French Five-Factor Model:
α = Rp - [Rf + βM(RM-Rf) + βSMB×SMB + βHML×HML + βRMW×RMW + βCMA×CMA]

Where:
- RM-Rf = Market risk premium
- SMB = Small Minus Big (size)
- HML = High Minus Low (value)
- RMW = Robust Minus Weak (profitability)
- CMA = Conservative Minus Aggressive (investment)
```

### Comparison Example

Two portfolios both returned 15% vs. market's 10%:

| Portfolio | Jensen's Alpha | Factor Exposures | Fama-French Alpha |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Value Fund | 5% | High value, high size | 1.5% |
| Stock Picker | 5% | Neutral all factors | 4.8% |

The Stock Picker has genuine skill; the Value Fund mostly rode factor exposures.

### Common Factor Models

| Model | Factors | Use Case |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **CAPM** | Market | Basic alpha |
| **Fama-French 3** | Market, Size, Value | Traditional |
| **Carhart 4** | + Momentum | Include trends |
| **Fama-French 5** | + Profitability, Investment | Current standard |
| **Custom** | Industry-specific factors | Specialized analysis |

### Historical Context

**Eugene Fama and Kenneth French** (1993) developed the three-factor model showing that size and value explain returns beyond market beta. They expanded to five factors in 2015. This revolutionized how we evaluate active management.

### What It Reveals

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| High factor-adjusted alpha | Genuine skill, justifies fees |
| Low factor-adjusted alpha | Factor exposure, not skill |
| Negative factor-adjusted alpha | Destroying value vs. factors |

### Data Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Minimum | 36 months for basic estimate |
| Preferred | 60+ months for stable estimates |
| Factor Data | Need factor portfolio returns |
| Statistical Test | t-statistic should exceed 2.0 |

<Warning>
Factor loadings (betas) are time-varying. Use rolling estimation and be cautious about conclusions from short periods.
</Warning>

### Limitations

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Model Dependency** | Different factor models give different alphas |
| **Missing Factors** | If true factors not in model, alpha still contaminated |
| **Data Intensive** | Requires factor return data and regression |
| **Time-Varying** | Factor exposures change over time |

### Modern Extensions

Beyond Fama-French, sophisticated analysis includes:

- **Betting Against Beta (BAB)**: Low-beta stock premium
- **Quality Minus Junk (QMJ)**: Quality factor
- **Liquidity Factor**: Compensation for illiquidity
- **Momentum**: Trend persistence

Managers are now evaluated against 8-10 factor models.
