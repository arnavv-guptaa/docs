Value investing targets stocks trading below their intrinsic worth based on fundamentals like earnings, book value, or cash flow. It's one of the oldest and most researched investment approaches.

## Beginner

### What It Means

Value investing is about buying stocks that are "on sale" - companies trading at low prices relative to their fundamentals. The idea is simple: if a company is worth \$100 but trades at \$60, buying it should eventually pay off when the market recognizes its true value.

### Portfolio Example

Company A trades at \$40 per share but analysis suggests it's worth \$60 based on its assets, earnings, and cash flows. A value investor buys, expecting the price to rise toward \$60 over time.

### Classic Value Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | "Cheap" Means |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| P/E Ratio | Price vs. Earnings | Lower is cheaper |
| P/B Ratio | Price vs. Book Value | Lower is cheaper |
| EV/EBITDA | Enterprise Value vs. Cash Flow | Lower is cheaper |
| Dividend Yield | Dividends vs. Price | Higher is cheaper |

### Why It Matters

Value investing has a long track record of success, championed by legendary investors like Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. Understanding value helps identify potentially underpriced opportunities.

### The Value Premium

Academic research documents that cheap stocks (by various measures) tend to outperform expensive stocks over time:

| Period | Value Premium (HML) |
|--------|---------------------|
| 1926-2023 | ~3-4% annually |
| 1963-2006 | ~5% annually |
| 2007-2020 | Near zero or negative |

<Warning>
Value significantly underperformed from 2007-2020, leading many to question whether the premium persists. The 2020s have seen some value recovery.
</Warning>

### Why Value May Work

**Risk-Based Explanations:**
- Value stocks are riskier (distress risk, leverage)
- Higher returns compensate for higher risk
- Value stocks do worse in recessions

**Behavioral Explanations:**
- Investors overreact to bad news, pushing prices too low
- Glamour/growth stocks get overvalued due to excessive optimism
- Mean reversion in fundamentals isn't fully priced

### Value Metrics Deep Dive

| Metric | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **P/E** | Simple, widely used | Earnings can be manipulated |
| **P/B** | Stable, hard to manipulate | Less relevant for asset-light businesses |
| **EV/EBITDA** | Accounts for debt | Ignores capex requirements |
| **FCF Yield** | Cash-based, hard to fake | Volatile year-to-year |

### Modern Value Challenges

Traditional value metrics face challenges in the modern economy:

| Challenge | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| **Intangibles** | R&D, brand value not on balance sheet |
| **Asset-Light Business** | Tech companies have little book value |
| **Low Interest Rates** | Growth stocks benefited disproportionately |
| **Winner-Take-All** | Scale advantages make "cheap" stocks genuinely worse |

### Value Traps

<Note>
A **value trap** is a stock that looks cheap but deserves to be cheap - the low price reflects genuine problems, not market inefficiency.
</Note>

**Signs of a Value Trap:**
- Declining industry (newspapers, retail)
- Persistent earnings deterioration
- Weak competitive position
- High debt with refinancing risk
- Management quality issues

### Value vs. Growth

| Characteristic | Value | Growth |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| Valuation | Low P/E, P/B | High P/E, P/B |
| Expectations | Low, beaten down | High, optimistic |
| Risk Profile | Distress risk | Duration risk |
| Performance | Better in recoveries | Better in expansions |

### Combining Value with Quality

Modern approaches combine value with quality screens:

```
Traditional Value: Buy cheapest stocks
Quality Value: Buy cheap stocks that are also profitable and stable

Adding quality filters helps avoid value traps
```

### Historical Drawdowns

Value can underperform for extended periods:

| Period | Value vs. Growth |
|--------|------------------|
| 1998-2000 | -60% (dot-com bubble) |
| 2017-2020 | -40% (growth dominance) |

These periods test investor patience and commitment to the strategy.

### Data Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Fundamental Data | Earnings, book value, cash flows |
| History | Quarterly updates, annual comparisons |
| Normalization | Adjust for cyclicality, one-time items |
