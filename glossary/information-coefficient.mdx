---

The Information Coefficient (IC) measures how good you are at predicting which stocks will outperform. It's the correlation between your predictions and actual outcomes - the purest measure of investment skill.

## Beginner

### What It Means

IC answers: "When I predict a stock will do well, how often is that prediction correct?" It's measured as a correlation, ranging from -1 to +1.

### Portfolio Example

At the start of each quarter, you predict expected returns for 100 stocks. At quarter end, you compare predictions to actual returns.

| IC Value | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| 0.00 | No predictive ability (random guessing) |
| 0.03 | Weak but positive skill |
| 0.05 | Typical skilled manager |
| 0.10 | Strong skill (rare) |

### Why It Matters

IC directly measures forecasting skill - the core of active management value. If you can't predict which stocks will outperform, you can't add value. IC tells you if your predictions have any merit.

### Mathematical Definition

```
IC = Correlation(Forecast Returns, Realized Returns)

IC = Cov(f, r) / (σf × σr)

Where:
- f = Forecasted returns
- r = Realized returns
- Range: -1.0 to +1.0
```

### Realistic IC Values

Most investors overestimate achievable IC:

| Manager Type | Typical IC |
|--------------|------------|
| Bottom Decile | -0.02 to +0.01 |
| Median Manager | 0.02 - 0.04 |
| Top Quartile | 0.05 - 0.08 |
| Top Decile | 0.08 - 0.12 |

<Warning>
An IC of 0.10 is exceptional. Claims of IC above 0.15 should be viewed with extreme skepticism.
</Warning>

### The Fundamental Law of Active Management

IC connects to expected performance through:

```
E(IR) = IC × √BR

Where:
- IR = Information Ratio
- IC = Information Coefficient
- BR = Breadth (independent bets per year)
```

**Example:**
- IC = 0.05, BR = 100 independent bets
- E(IR) = 0.05 × √100 = 0.05 × 10 = 0.50

### Why Small IC Matters

Even tiny IC creates value with enough breadth:

| IC | Breadth | Expected IR |
|----|---------|-------------|
| 0.02 | 100 | 0.20 |
| 0.05 | 100 | 0.50 |
| 0.05 | 400 | 1.00 |
| 0.10 | 100 | 1.00 |

<Note>
The law shows two paths to high IR: better skill (higher IC) or more independent bets (higher breadth). Most quant strategies focus on breadth since IC is hard to improve.
</Note>

### IC Stability

IC is not constant:

| Factor | Effect on IC |
|--------|--------------|
| **Market Volatility** | Higher dispersion = higher achievable IC |
| **Regime Changes** | IC varies across bull/bear markets |
| **Strategy Crowding** | More users = lower IC |
| **Information Decay** | Signals lose power over time |

### Measuring IC

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Cross-Sectional** | Rank correlation each period across all stocks |
| **Time-Series** | Track individual stock forecast accuracy over time |
| **Quintile Spreads** | Top quintile return minus bottom quintile |

### Data Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Observations | 100+ independent forecasts minimum |
| Preferred | 500+ forecasts for stable IC estimate |
| Time Coverage | Multiple periods to confirm consistency |
| Cross-Sectional | 50-100 stocks per period typical |

### Limitations

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Hard to Measure** | Requires detailed forecast data |
| **Time-Varying** | IC changes across market conditions |
| **Implementation Gap** | Forecast IC differs from realized portfolio IC |
| **Correlation Effects** | High correlations reduce effective breadth |

### IC vs. Hit Ratio

| Metric | Measures | Considers Magnitude? |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| **Hit Ratio** | Frequency of correct direction | No |
| **IC** | Correlation with outcomes | Yes |

IC is more comprehensive because it accounts for both direction and magnitude of predictions.
