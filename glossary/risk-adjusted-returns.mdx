---

Risk-adjusted returns measure investment performance relative to the risk taken to achieve those returns. A 15% return with 20% volatility may be worse than 10% return with 5% volatility.

## Beginner

### What It Means

Raw returns don't tell the whole story. Risk-adjusted returns answer the question: "How much return did I get for each unit of risk I took?" Higher risk-adjusted returns mean more efficient use of risk.

### Portfolio Example

| Portfolio | Return | Volatility | Risk-Adjusted? |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| Portfolio A | 15% | 20% | Lower |
| Portfolio B | 12% | 8% | Higher |

Portfolio B is actually better - it generated nearly as much return with far less risk. You could leverage Portfolio B to match Portfolio A's risk and get higher returns.

### Why It Matters

Comparing raw returns is misleading. A hedge fund returning 20% with 40% volatility isn't necessarily better than an index fund returning 10% with 15% volatility. Risk-adjusted metrics reveal true performance quality.

### Key Risk-Adjusted Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Best For |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Sharpe Ratio** | (Return - Rf) / Volatility | General comparison |
| **Sortino Ratio** | (Return - Rf) / Downside Dev | Downside-focused |
| **Treynor Ratio** | (Return - Rf) / Beta | Diversified portfolios |
| **Information Ratio** | Alpha / Tracking Error | Active managers |
| **Calmar Ratio** | Return / Max Drawdown | Drawdown-sensitive |

### Sharpe Ratio

The most common risk-adjusted measure:

```
Sharpe Ratio = (Rp - Rf) / σp

Where:
- Rp = Portfolio return
- Rf = Risk-free rate
- σp = Portfolio volatility
```

| Sharpe | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| Below 0.5 | Below average |
| 0.5 - 1.0 | Good |
| 1.0 - 1.5 | Very good |
| Above 1.5 | Excellent (rare) |

### Sortino Ratio

Focuses only on downside risk:

```
Sortino Ratio = (Rp - Rf) / Downside Deviation

Downside Deviation = Only negative returns count
```

<Note>
Sortino is often preferred because investors don't mind upside volatility - only downside hurts. A stock that jumps 10% isn't "risky" in any meaningful sense.
</Note>

### Calmar Ratio

Uses maximum drawdown as the risk measure:

```
Calmar Ratio = Annual Return / |Maximum Drawdown|
```

| Calmar | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| Below 0.5 | Poor |
| 0.5 - 1.0 | Acceptable |
| 1.0 - 2.0 | Good |
| Above 2.0 | Excellent |

### Comparing Metrics

| Metric | Risk Measure | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| **Sharpe** | Total volatility | Simple, universal | Penalizes upside |
| **Sortino** | Downside only | More intuitive | Fewer data points |
| **Calmar** | Max drawdown | Captures tail risk | Single worst event |
| **Information** | Tracking error | Active management focus | Benchmark dependent |

### Practical Application

**When to use each metric:**

- **Sharpe**: Comparing any strategies against each other
- **Sortino**: When you care specifically about losses
- **Calmar**: When drawdowns are your primary concern
- **Information Ratio**: Evaluating active managers vs. benchmark
- **Treynor**: Comparing well-diversified portfolios

### Limitations

- **Backward-Looking**: Past risk-adjusted returns don't guarantee future performance
- **Distribution Assumptions**: Most assume normal returns (reality has fat tails)
- **Time Period Sensitive**: Results vary significantly by measurement period
- **Gaming**: Some strategies artificially inflate ratios (selling options, smoothing)

<Warning>
A high Sharpe Ratio from selling options or illiquid strategies may mask hidden tail risks. Always understand the source of risk-adjusted returns.
