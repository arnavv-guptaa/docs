Asset allocation is how you divide your portfolio among different asset classes: stocks, bonds, cash, real estate, and alternatives. Research shows it's the most important investment decision you'll make.

## Beginner

### What It Means

Asset allocation is your portfolio's recipe - how much of each ingredient (asset class) to include. It determines your risk level and expected return more than any other decision.

### Common Allocations

| Profile | Stocks | Bonds | Cash | Risk Level |
|---------|--------|-------|------|------------|
| Aggressive | 90% | 10% | 0% | High |
| Growth | 80% | 20% | 0% | Moderate-High |
| Balanced | 60% | 40% | 0% | Moderate |
| Conservative | 40% | 50% | 10% | Low-Moderate |
| Preservation | 20% | 60% | 20% | Low |

### The 60/40 Portfolio

The classic "balanced" portfolio: 60% stocks, 40% bonds. It's a common starting point that balances growth potential with stability.

### Why It Matters

Research shows asset allocation explains about 90% of portfolio return variability over time. Individual stock selection matters far less than your mix of stocks vs. bonds vs. other assets.

### The 90% Rule

**Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986)** found that asset allocation explains over 90% of the variation in portfolio returns over time. This landmark study shifted focus from stock picking to strategic allocation.

<Note>
This doesn't mean 90% of returns come from allocation - it means 90% of return *differences* between portfolios are explained by allocation differences.
</Note>

### Strategic vs. Tactical

| Approach | Description | Typical Changes |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Strategic** | Long-term target allocation | Rarely changed |
| **Tactical** | Short-term adjustments | Quarterly or more |
| **Dynamic** | Rules-based adjustments | Automatic triggers |

### Asset Class Characteristics

| Asset Class | Expected Return | Volatility | Role |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|------|
| **Equities** | Highest | Highest | Growth |
| **Bonds** | Moderate | Low-Moderate | Income, Stability |
| **Cash** | Lowest | Lowest | Liquidity, Safety |
| **Real Estate** | Moderate-High | Moderate | Diversification, Income |
| **Commodities** | Variable | High | Inflation hedge |
| **Alternatives** | Variable | Variable | Diversification |

### Historical Returns

Long-term annualized returns (US, approximate):

| Asset Class | Return | Volatility |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| US Stocks | 10% | 16% |
| International Stocks | 8% | 18% |
| US Bonds | 5% | 4% |
| Cash/T-Bills | 3% | 1% |
| REITs | 9% | 18% |

### Allocation by Age

Traditional rule of thumb: "100 minus your age" in stocks.

| Age | Stocks | Bonds |
|-----|--------|-------|
| 25 | 75% | 25% |
| 40 | 60% | 40% |
| 55 | 45% | 55% |
| 70 | 30% | 70% |

<Warning>
This is a rough guideline only. Individual circumstances (risk tolerance, other assets, income needs) matter more than age alone.
</Warning>

### Modern Portfolio Theory

**Harry Markowitz (1952)** showed how to optimize allocation for maximum return at each risk level - the "efficient frontier."

Key insight: Combining assets with low correlation reduces portfolio risk below the weighted average of individual risks.

### Factors Affecting Allocation

| Factor | Impact on Stocks % |
|--------|-------------------|
| Longer time horizon | Higher |
| Higher risk tolerance | Higher |
| Stable income | Higher |
| Large emergency fund | Higher |
| Near-term spending needs | Lower |

### Rebalancing

Asset allocation drifts as markets move. Rebalancing returns the portfolio to target:

- After stocks rise: Sell stocks, buy bonds
- After stocks fall: Sell bonds, buy stocks

This enforces "buy low, sell high" discipline.

### Data and Implementation

| Consideration | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| Review Frequency | Annually at minimum |
| Rebalancing Trigger | 5% drift from target typical |
| Tax Efficiency | Rebalance in tax-advantaged accounts first |
| Costs | Consider transaction costs vs. precision |
