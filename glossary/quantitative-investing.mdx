---

Quantitative investing uses mathematical models, statistical analysis, and systematic rules to make investment decisions. It replaces subjective judgment with data-driven processes.

## Beginner

### What It Means

Quantitative (or "quant") investing uses computers and data to make investment decisions instead of gut feelings or qualitative analysis. The rules are explicit, testable, and consistently applied.

### How It Works

1. **Identify patterns** in historical data
2. **Build models** that capture those patterns
3. **Test rigorously** on out-of-sample data
4. **Implement systematically** without emotion
5. **Monitor and refine** continuously

### Quant vs. Traditional

| Aspect | Quant | Traditional |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Decision Making | Rules-based, algorithmic | Judgment-based, intuitive |
| Data | Massive datasets, many signals | Company-specific research |
| Holdings | Hundreds to thousands | Typically 30-100 |
| Emotion | Removed by design | Human element |
| Scalability | High | Limited |

### Why It Matters

Quant investing removes emotional biases (fear, greed, overconfidence) and enables processing of far more information than humans can handle manually. It brings scientific rigor to investment management.

### Quant Strategy Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Factor-Based** | Target proven return drivers | Value, momentum, quality |
| **Statistical Arbitrage** | Exploit price relationships | Pairs trading |
| **Machine Learning** | Pattern recognition | Neural networks |
| **High-Frequency** | Speed-based strategies | Market making |
| **Risk Parity** | Allocate by risk contribution | Bridgewater All Weather |

### The Quant Process

```
1. Hypothesis Generation
   - Academic research
   - Market observations
   - Economic theory

2. Data Collection
   - Price data
   - Fundamental data
   - Alternative data

3. Signal Construction
   - Factor definitions
   - Composite scores
   - Timing signals

4. Backtesting
   - Historical simulation
   - Out-of-sample testing
   - Robustness checks

5. Portfolio Construction
   - Optimization
   - Risk constraints
   - Transaction costs

6. Execution
   - Algorithmic trading
   - Market impact minimization

7. Monitoring
   - Performance attribution
   - Model decay detection
```

### Data Sources

| Data Type | Examples | Use |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| **Market Data** | Prices, volumes, order book | Trading signals |
| **Fundamental** | Financials, estimates | Value, quality factors |
| **Alternative** | Satellite, sentiment, web | Unique insights |
| **Macro** | GDP, rates, inflation | Regime detection |

### Backtesting Pitfalls

<Warning>
Backtesting can be misleading. Common errors:

- **Overfitting**: Finding patterns that don't persist
- **Look-Ahead Bias**: Using data not available at decision time
- **Survivorship Bias**: Testing only on stocks that survived
- **Transaction Costs**: Ignoring realistic trading costs
</Warning>

### Machine Learning in Quant

| Technique | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Regression** | Return prediction |
| **Classification** | Buy/sell signals |
| **Clustering** | Regime detection |
| **NLP** | Sentiment analysis |
| **Neural Networks** | Complex pattern recognition |

<Note>
Machine learning requires even more caution about overfitting. More complex models are easier to overfit to historical noise.
</Note>

### Quant vs. Discretionary

| Factor | Quant | Discretionary |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Capacity** | Higher | Lower |
| **Consistency** | Very high | Variable |
| **Adaptability** | Slower | Faster |
| **Transparency** | High | Lower |
| **Crowding Risk** | Higher | Lower |

### Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Alpha Decay** | Signals lose power as they become known |
| **Crowding** | Too many quants trading same signals |
| **Regime Changes** | Models built on past may not work in future |
| **Data Quality** | Garbage in, garbage out |
| **Black Swan Events** | Models fail in unprecedented conditions |
