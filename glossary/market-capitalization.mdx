---

Market capitalization (market cap) is the total market value of a company's outstanding shares. It's the primary measure of company size in investing and forms the basis of major stock indices.

## Beginner

### What It Means

Market cap tells you what the market thinks a company is worth. It's calculated by multiplying the stock price by the total number of shares outstanding.

```
Market Cap = Share Price × Shares Outstanding
```

### Example

| Company | Share Price | Shares Outstanding | Market Cap |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| Company A | \$50 | 2 million | \$100 million |
| Company B | \$200 | 500,000 | \$100 million |

Both companies have the same market cap despite very different share prices. Share price alone doesn't tell you company size.

### Size Categories

| Category | Market Cap Range | Examples |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| **Mega-Cap** | >\$200 billion | Apple, Microsoft, Amazon |
| **Large-Cap** | \$10B - \$200B | Most S&P 500 companies |
| **Mid-Cap** | \$2B - \$10B | Regional leaders |
| **Small-Cap** | \$300M - \$2B | Growing companies |
| **Micro-Cap** | <\$300 million | Very small public companies |

### Why It Matters

Market cap determines:
- Which indices include a stock (S&P 500, Russell 2000, etc.)
- How much of an index a stock represents
- Liquidity and trading characteristics
- Risk and return expectations

### Market Cap vs. Other Size Measures

| Measure | Definition | Use Case |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Market Cap** | Price × Shares | Most common size measure |
| **Enterprise Value** | Market Cap + Debt - Cash | Acquisition value, better for comparisons |
| **Revenue** | Annual sales | Size of operations |
| **Total Assets** | Balance sheet assets | For financials, regulated industries |

### Float-Adjusted Market Cap

Most indices use float-adjusted market cap:

```
Float-Adjusted Market Cap = Price × Float Shares

Float Shares = Total Shares - Insider Holdings - Restricted Shares
```

This counts only shares actually available for trading, excluding:
- Insider holdings (executives, founders)
- Government holdings
- Strategic holdings by other companies
- Restricted stock

### Index Weighting

Market cap determines portfolio weights in cap-weighted indices:

```
S&P 500 Example (simplified):
- Apple: $3T market cap → ~7% of index
- Small company: $50B market cap → ~0.1% of index
```

<Note>
Cap-weighted indices are "self-rebalancing" - as stocks rise, their weight naturally increases. No trading required to maintain weights.
</Note>

### The Size Factor

Academic research documents the "size premium" - historically, smaller companies have outperformed larger ones:

| Period | Small-Cap Premium |
|--------|-------------------|
| 1926-2023 | ~2-3% annually |
| 1980-2000 | Significant |
| 2000-2020 | Near zero or negative |

<Warning>
The size premium has been inconsistent in recent decades. Small-cap outperformance is not guaranteed and comes with higher volatility.
</Warning>

### Market Cap Characteristics by Size

| Characteristic | Large-Cap | Small-Cap |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Volatility | Lower | Higher |
| Liquidity | High | Lower |
| Analyst Coverage | Extensive | Limited |
| Information Efficiency | High | Lower |
| Trading Costs | Low | Higher |

### Dynamic Nature

Market cap changes continuously:
- Stock price movements
- Share buybacks (reduces shares, may increase price)
- Stock issuance (increases shares, may decrease price)
- Stock splits (no effect on market cap)

### Sector Distribution by Size

Different sectors dominate different size segments:

| Segment | Dominant Sectors |
|---------|------------------|
| Mega-Cap | Technology, Healthcare |
| Large-Cap | Financials, Industrials |
| Mid-Cap | Industrials, Consumer |
| Small-Cap | Financials, Healthcare, Industrials |

### Limitations

- **Price-Based**: Reflects market sentiment, not intrinsic value
- **Volatile**: Can change dramatically with price swings
- **Debt-Blind**: Doesn't account for leverage (use Enterprise Value)
- **Industry Differences**: Hard to compare across sectors
