A systematic strategy is a rules-based investment approach where decisions follow predetermined criteria. If conditions A, B, and C are met, action X is taken - no discretion, no emotion.

## Beginner

### What It Means

Systematic strategies operate on explicit rules. Every decision - what to buy, when to sell, how much to hold - follows predefined logic that a computer can execute.

### Simple Example

```
Systematic Value Strategy:
1. Every quarter, rank all stocks by P/E ratio
2. Buy the 50 cheapest stocks
3. Sell any stock that rises above median P/E
4. Equal weight all positions
```

No judgment calls. No "this time is different." Just follow the rules.

### Systematic vs. Discretionary

| Aspect | Systematic | Discretionary |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Decisions | Rules-based | Judgment-based |
| Emotion | Removed | Present |
| Consistency | Very high | Variable |
| Backtesting | Easy | Difficult |
| Adaptability | Slower | Faster |

### Why It Matters

Systematic strategies eliminate behavioral biases that hurt returns: panic selling, greed buying, overconfidence, and inconsistency. They enforce discipline when emotions would otherwise take over.

### Types of Systematic Strategies

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Factor-Based** | Target return drivers | Value, momentum |
| **Trend Following** | Follow price trends | Managed futures |
| **Mean Reversion** | Bet on return to normal | Pairs trading |
| **Risk Parity** | Allocate by risk | Equal risk contribution |
| **Rules-Based Indexing** | Enhanced indexing | Smart beta |

### Building a Systematic Strategy

```
1. Define Investment Universe
   - Which securities to consider
   - Liquidity and size filters

2. Specify Signal Generation
   - What data to use
   - How to calculate signals
   - Ranking methodology

3. Set Portfolio Construction Rules
   - Position sizing
   - Sector constraints
   - Risk limits

4. Establish Rebalancing Rules
   - Frequency
   - Threshold triggers
   - Transaction cost considerations

5. Define Risk Management
   - Stop-loss rules
   - Maximum position sizes
   - Correlation limits
```

### Benefits of Systematic Approach

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Discipline** | Rules prevent emotional decisions |
| **Consistency** | Same process every time |
| **Scalability** | Can manage large amounts |
| **Transparency** | Clear reasoning for every trade |
| **Backtesting** | Can test before risking capital |
| **Diversification** | Can hold many positions |

### Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Overfitting** | Rules that worked historically may not persist |
| **Crowding** | Many systematic investors use similar rules |
| **Regime Changes** | Rules may fail in new market conditions |
| **Model Decay** | Signals lose power over time |
| **Black Swans** | Unprecedented events break models |

<Warning>
Past performance of backtested strategies often overstates future performance. Always stress test for scenarios not in historical data.
</Warning>

### Systematic vs. Algorithmic vs. Quant

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Systematic** | Rules-based decisions (any speed) |
| **Algorithmic** | Computer-executed (often fast) |
| **Quantitative** | Data-driven, mathematical |

These overlap significantly but aren't identical. A strategy can be systematic without being high-frequency algorithmic.

### Rebalancing Approaches

| Approach | Description | Trade-off |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Calendar** | Fixed schedule (monthly, quarterly) | Simple but may miss signals |
| **Signal-Based** | When signals change significantly | Responsive but higher turnover |
| **Threshold** | When positions drift beyond bands | Balances responsiveness and costs |

### Risk Management in Systematic Strategies

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Position Limits** | Maximum weight per holding |
| **Sector Limits** | Maximum weight per sector |
| **Volatility Targeting** | Adjust exposure to target vol |
| **Stop-Losses** | Exit rules on losses |
| **Correlation Monitoring** | Avoid concentrated bets |

### Performance Characteristics

Systematic strategies often have:

- Lower volatility than concentrated stock picking
- More consistent (but perhaps smaller) alpha
- Capacity constraints as assets grow
- Factor exposure embedded in returns

<Note>
Pure systematic strategies may underperform during transitions or unprecedented events, but outperform over full cycles by avoiding behavioral errors.
