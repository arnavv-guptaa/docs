---

Volatility measures how much and how quickly prices fluctuate. It's the market's gauge of uncertainty and risk, often called the "fear factor" when it spikes.

## Beginner

### What It Means

Volatility tells you how wildly prices are swinging. High volatility means big daily moves (up or down). Low volatility means calm, steady price action.

### Market Conditions

| Volatility Level | What It Feels Like |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Low (VIX < 15) | Calm markets, small daily moves (±0.5%) |
| Normal (VIX 15-20) | Typical conditions, moderate moves (±1%) |
| Elevated (VIX 20-30) | Nervous markets, larger swings (±1.5%) |
| High (VIX > 30) | Fear and uncertainty, big moves (±2-3%+) |

### The VIX - Fear Gauge

The VIX (Volatility Index) measures expected S&P 500 volatility over the next 30 days. It's widely watched as a barometer of market fear.

| VIX Level | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Below 15 | Complacency, calm |
| 15-20 | Normal |
| 20-30 | Elevated concern |
| Above 30 | High fear |
| Above 40 | Panic (rare) |

### Why It Matters

Volatility affects everything: trading decisions, option prices, risk management, and investor psychology. Understanding volatility helps you prepare for and navigate different market conditions.

### Volatility vs. Standard Deviation

Volatility and standard deviation are closely related but not identical:

| Term | Usage |
|------|-------|
| **Standard Deviation** | Statistical measure of return dispersion |
| **Volatility** | Often refers to annualized standard deviation or implied volatility |
| **Realized Volatility** | Historical, calculated from past returns |
| **Implied Volatility** | Forward-looking, derived from option prices |

### Calculating Volatility

```
Realized Volatility (annualized):
σ_annual = σ_daily × √252

Where 252 = trading days per year

Example:
- Daily std dev: 1%
- Annualized volatility: 1% × √252 = 15.9%
```

### Volatility Clustering

**Key Insight**: Volatility begets volatility. High-volatility days tend to follow high-volatility days, and calm periods persist.

```
Empirical Pattern:
- After a 3%+ daily move, expect above-average volatility for weeks
- After weeks of <0.5% daily moves, expect continued calm
- Volatility mean-reverts but slowly
```

<Note>
This clustering effect is captured by GARCH models, developed by Robert Engle (Nobel Prize 2003) and Tim Bollerslev.
</Note>

### Implied vs. Realized Volatility

| Type | Source | Use |
|------|--------|-----|
| **Implied** | Option prices | Forward-looking expectation |
| **Realized** | Historical returns | What actually happened |

The gap between them is the **volatility risk premium**:
- Implied usually exceeds realized (investors pay for protection)
- This premium averages 2-4% annually

### Volatility Regimes

Markets exhibit distinct volatility regimes:

| Regime | Characteristics | Duration |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Low Vol** | VIX < 15, steady gains | Months to years |
| **Normal** | VIX 15-20, typical markets | Most common |
| **High Vol** | VIX > 25, large swings | Weeks to months |
| **Crisis** | VIX > 40, extreme moves | Days to weeks |

<Warning>
Regime changes happen suddenly. Markets can shift from calm to crisis in days. Don't assume current conditions will persist.
</Warning>

### Volatility and Returns

**The Low Volatility Anomaly**: Counterintuitively, low-volatility stocks have historically outperformed high-volatility stocks on a risk-adjusted basis.

| Stock Type | Return | Volatility | Sharpe |
|------------|--------|------------|--------|
| Low Vol | Lower | Much Lower | Higher |
| High Vol | Higher | Much Higher | Lower |

This contradicts traditional finance theory (higher risk should mean higher returns).

### Volatility Smile/Skew

Option markets reveal more nuanced volatility expectations:

```
Volatility Skew:
- Out-of-the-money puts have higher implied vol than calls
- Markets price in crash risk (fat left tail)
- Steeper skew = more fear of downside
```

### Practical Applications

| Application | How Volatility Is Used |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Position Sizing | Smaller positions in high-vol assets |
| Risk Budgeting | Allocate risk, not just dollars |
| Option Trading | Buy/sell based on vol views |
| Hedging | Hedge more when vol is low (cheaper) |

### Data Sources

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| VIX | S&P 500 implied volatility |
| VVIX | Volatility of VIX (vol of vol) |
| VXN | Nasdaq 100 implied volatility |
| Historical | Calculate from price history |
