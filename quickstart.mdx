## Understanding Your Analysis

When you analyze a portfolio, you'll see scores across six factors:

| Factor | What It Measures | High Score Means |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Value** | Price vs. fundamentals | Undervalued relative to peers |
| **Quality** | Business strength | Strong margins, low debt, stable earnings |
| **Momentum** | Price trends | Positive recent performance |
| **Defensive** | Risk characteristics | Lower volatility, downside protection |
| **Size** | Market cap impact | Benefits from size-based premiums |
| **Tactical** | Short-term signals | Favorable near-term positioning |

<Note>
Scores range from 0-10. A balanced portfolio typically has moderate scores across multiple factors rather than extreme scores in one.
